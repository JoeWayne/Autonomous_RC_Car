# Autonomous_RC_Car

## Objective
Develop a ROS AprilTags tracking system for our RC car to follow a targeted RC car. An AprilTag is placed behind the leading car for detection purposes, which will serve as a reference point for the distance and position of the leading car with respect to our car. With the measurements obtained from the AprilTag and by implementing ROS, we can control the throttle and steering of our car to follow the identified car.

## Results
We successfully completed our original goal of an autonomous lap around the Warren Tents track, following another human-controlled car with an AprilTag on the back. The trailing car successfully finished a lap without ever crashing into a cone or going out of the designated lanes. The distance was set to be around half a meter with our throttle and steering controllers.
